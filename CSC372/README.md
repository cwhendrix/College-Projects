## CSC 374 - Theory of Computation, Dr. William Bailey - Spring 2024
An introduction to the study of abstract models of computation and languages and to the use of formal methods in computer science. Topics include finite state automata and regular expressions, context free grammars and pushdown automata, Turing machines, Churchâ€™s thesis, decision problems, and undecidable problems.
The only formal program written for this class was a JSON parser. 

### JSON+ Parser (json_parser.py)
A homebrew JSON parser, which extends standard JSON with support for sets and complex numbers. This program takes one command line argument when run: the name of the file which contains the JSON object. It takes a given JSON object and forms it into a dictionary.
